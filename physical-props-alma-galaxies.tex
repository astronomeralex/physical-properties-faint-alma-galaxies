\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This bias of these galaxies was significantly lower than that of traditional SMG and pBzK galaxies, 
and similar to those of sBzKs, LBGs, and LAEs. 

We adopt the standard concordance cosmology of $h = 0.7$, $\Omega_m = 0.3$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$, 
and $\Omega_k = 0$ \citep{planck13}.

\section{Sample Selection} 
\label{sec:sample}

Our sample comes from \cite{fujimoto15}, who studied serendipitously discovered sub-mm galaxies in 
120 deep ALMA pointings. This work achieved depths of 0.05 mJy at 1.2mm in the field and 0.02 mJy 
with the assistance of gravitational lensing in A1689; it discovered a total of 133 galaxies, of which 65 galaxies 
were in SXDS and A1689, which both have a rich set of multi-wavelength imaging. Of the 65 galaxies, 
17 are detected in the optical - NIR images and thus spectral energy distribution fitting can be applied to 
understand the physical properties of this sample. Two of these sources are in A1689 and the remaining
15 are in SXDS.

The photometry for our analysis comes from a variety of multi-wavelength surveys in these fields.
In SXDS we use the following bands \textit{u*} (Foucaud et al., in prep.), \textit{B, V, R, i', z'} \citep{furusawa08},
\textit{J, H, K} \citep[UKIDSS;\footnotemark][]{lawrence07} 3.6 - 24 $\mu$m \citep[SWIRE, SpUDS, SEDS;][]{lonsdale03, ashby13}
250 - 500 $\mu$m \citep[HerMES;][]{oliver12, smith12, wang14} and 1.4 GHz \citep{simpson06}.
In A1689 we use \textit{g$_{475}$, r$_{625}$, i$_{775}$, z$_{850}$, J$_{110}$} \& \textit{H}$_{160}$ from the \textit{Hubble Source Catalog}
(HSC; Whitmore et al., in prep), 3.6 - 24 $\mu$m from \textit{Spitzer} Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP), and 250 - 500 $\mu$m (HerMES).

\footnotetext{The UKIDSS project is defined in \citet{lawrence07}. UKIDSS uses the UKIRT 
Wide Field Camera \citet[WFCAM][]{casali07}. The photometric system is described in 
\citet{hewett06}, and the calibration is described in \citet{hodgkin09}. 
The pipeline processing and science archive are described in \citet{hambly08}.}
