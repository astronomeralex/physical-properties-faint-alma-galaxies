\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This bias of these galaxies was significantly lower than that of traditional SMG and pBzK galaxies, 
and similar to those of sBzKs, LBGs, and LAEs. 

We adopt the standard concordance cosmology of $h = 0.7$, $\Omega_m = 0.3$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$, 
and $\Omega_k = 0$ \citep{planck13}.

\section{Sample Selection} 
\label{sec:sample}

Our sample comes from \citet{fujimoto15}, hereafter F15, who studied serendipitously discovered sub-mm galaxies in 
120 deep ALMA pointings pulled from the ALMA archive. This work achieved depths of 0.05 mJy at 1.2mm in the field and 0.02 mJy 
with the assistance of gravitational lensing in A1689; it discovered a total of 133 galaxies. Many of the ALMA observations in F15 were not
in deep fields with ancillary photometry sufficient to identify counterparts. Thus, F15 focused on identifying counterparts in Subaru XMM-Newton Deep 
Survey \citep[SXDS;][]{furusawa08} and Abel 1689 (A1689), both of which are covered by multi-wavelength surveys. 
Out of 65 serendipitous ALMA sources, F15 identified 17 counterparts -- 2 in A1689 and 15 in SXDS. 

% add in cosmos counterparts
To ensure were were not missing any counterparts, we searched for counterparts for each galaxy in 
We also identified an optical counterpart for F15 source ID 7 by searching through the \textit{Hubble} Source Catalog 
(HSC; Whitmore et al., in prep) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep[SDSS;][]{york2000} DR12 \citep{alam15} imaging data 
\citep{fukugita96, gunn98, hogg01, smith02, pier03, ivezic04, gunn06, tucker06, padmanabhan08, doi10}.

The photometry for our analysis for the counterparts identified in F15 comes from a variety of multi-wavelength surveys in these fields.
In SXDS we use the following bands \textit{u*} (Foucaud et al., in prep.), \textit{B, V, R, i', z'} \citep{furusawa08},
\textit{J, H, K} \citep[UKIDSS;\footnotemark][]{lawrence07} 3.6 - 24 $\mu$m \citep[SWIRE, SpUDS, SEDS;][]{lonsdale03, ashby13}
250 - 500 $\mu$m \citep[HerMES;][]{oliver12, smith12, wang14} and 1.4 GHz \citep{simpson06}.
In A1689 we use \textit{g$_{475}$, r$_{625}$, i$_{775}$, z$_{850}$, J$_{110}$} \& \textit{H}$_{160}$ from the \textit{Hubble} Source Catalog,
 3.6 - 24 $\mu$m from \textit{Spitzer} Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP), and 250 - 500 $\mu$m (HerMES).

\footnotetext{The UKIDSS project is defined in \citet{lawrence07}. UKIDSS uses the UKIRT 
Wide Field Camera \citet[WFCAM][]{casali07}. The photometric system is described in 
\citet{hewett06}, and the calibration is described in \citet{hodgkin09}. 
The pipeline processing and science archive are described in \citet{hambly08}.}
