\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Traditional sub-millimeter galaxies sample galaxies sample very dusty, highly star forming galaxies at high redshift \citep[e.g.][and references therein]{blain02, lagache05, casey14, lutz14}. These galaxies, as referred to as dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFG) to reference their physical properties instead of a possible detection technique, are some of the most intensely star forming galaxies in the known universe. Their discovery across redshifts is due to the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the dust blackbody curve almost perfectly cancelling out cosmological dimming from $1 \lesssim z \lesssim 8$ in the wavelength range of $850\text{$\mu$m} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 2\text{mm}$ \citep[See][Figure 3]{casey14}; this is referred to as the ``negative K correction."

Traditionally, SMGs were found with single-dish telescopes, which limited the resolution and thus made follow-up difficult. The addition Atacama Large Millimeter Array has given sub arcsecond resolution at sub-millimeter wavelengths, allowing for unprecedented studies of SMGs. The ALMA LABOCA ECDFS Submillimeter \citep[ALESS;][]{hodge13} used ALMA to study SMGs selected in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. \cite{dacunha15} showed that these ALESS SMGs have a wide range of physical properties, including some that have significantly less dust attenuation than expected; furthermore, half of these galaxies are above the stellar mass -- star formation rate relation, while the other half match the relation. This shows that SMGs are not just star-bursting galaxies, but cover a wide range of properties.

This paper focuses on galaxies first discussed in \cite{fujimoto16} serendipitously selected via deep 1.2mm archival ALMA observations. 
Studying these serendipitous sub-mm selected galaxies is important to understand the whole population of galaxies with sub-mm emission.
While classical SMGs are rare and in highly biased regions, F16 found that the bias of these galaxies was significantly lower than that of traditional SMG and pBzK galaxies, and similar to those of sBzKs, LBGs, and LAEs. This study is then one of the first opportunities to understand the physical properties of these galaxies. By understanding this we can further understand the sub-mm emission for less biased, more commonly found sub-mm galaxies, and improve our understanding of the physical properties of these galaxies.

We adopt the standard concordance cosmology of $h = 0.7$, $\Omega_m = 0.3$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$, 
and $\Omega_k = 0$ \citep{planck13}.

\section{Sample Selection} 
\label{sec:sample}

Our sample comes from \citet{fujimoto16}, hereafter F16, who studied serendipitously discovered sub-mm galaxies in 
120 deep ALMA pointings pulled from the ALMA archive. This work achieved depths of 0.05 mJy at 1.2mm in the field and 0.02 mJy 
with the assistance of gravitational lensing in A1689; it discovered a total of 133 galaxies. Many of the ALMA observations in F15 were not
in deep fields with ancillary photometry sufficient to identify counterparts. Thus, F16 focused on identifying counterparts in Subaru XMM-Newton Deep 
Survey \citep[SXDS;][]{furusawa08} and Abel 1689 (A1689), both of which are covered by multi-wavelength surveys. 
Out of 65 serendipitous ALMA sources, F15 identified 17 counterparts -- 2 in A1689 and 15 in SXDS. 

% add in cosmos counterparts
To ensure were were not missing any counterparts, we searched for counterparts for each galaxy in The NASA Extragalactic Data (NED), and
the \textit{Hubble} Source Catalog (HSC; Whitmore et al., in prep). This led us to discover YY new optical counterparts, 
mostly in the COMOS field \citep{COSMOS}. %have a table of new counterparts? and maybe a table of photometry?
We identified an optical counterpart for F15 source ID 7 originally found in the HSC and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep[SDSS;][]{york2000} 
DR12 \citep{alam15} imaging data \citep{fukugita96, gunn98, hogg01, smith02, pier03, ivezic04, gunn06, tucker06, padmanabhan08, doi10}.

The photometry for the counterparts identified in F15 comes from a variety of multi-wavelength surveys in SXDS and A1689.
In SXDS we use the following bands \textit{u*} (Foucaud et al., in prep.), \textit{B, V, R, i', z'} \citep{furusawa08},
\textit{J, H, K} \citep[UKIDSS;\footnotemark][]{lawrence07} 3.6 - 24 $\mu$m \citep[SWIRE, SpUDS, SEDS;][]{lonsdale03, ashby13}
250 - 500 $\mu$m \citep[HerMES;][]{oliver12, smith12, wang14} and 1.4 GHz \citep{simpson06}.
In A1689 we use \textit{g$_{475}$, r$_{625}$, i$_{775}$, z$_{850}$, J$_{110}$} \& \textit{H}$_{160}$ from the HSC,
 3.6 - 24 $\mu$m from \textit{Spitzer} Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP), and 250 - 500 $\mu$m (HerMES).

\section{Physical Properties}
\label{sec:analysis}

%talk about how important it is to have consistency in whole fit -- energy extinguished from dust heats dust, so there's energy balance
We use spectral energy distribution fitting (SED fitting) to infer physical properties of our sample of galaxies \citep[for a recent review of SED fitting see][]{conroy13}. It is of great importance to have energy balance in our SED fitting; the energy of the starlight attenuated by dust is reprocessed and emitted in the infrared. It is normally quite difficult to measure the dust emission, particularly in low-mass galaxies, and our sample of galaxies are selected in such a way that its possible to do this. Balancing the dust emission with the dust absorption allows for the degeneracy between age and dust attenuation, common in SED fitting that only doesn't include mid- and far-IR, to be broken. This allows for a better estimation of the star formation history as well.

We used two different software packages to model the SEDs of our galaxies, \texttt{Multi-wavelength Analysis of Galaxy Physical Properties} (MAGPHYS) \citep{dacunha08, dacunha15} and \texttt{Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis} (FSPS) \citep{conroy09, conroy10}. Both of these packages generate SEDs with inputs of physical parameters and stellar isochrones; the best-fit physical parameters and their uncertainties are found by maximizing the likelihood, using a Bayesian approach by taking priors into account when an informed prior can be found. MAGPHYS builds up the marginalized likelihood for each parameter by comparing the data to all combinations of models in a grid search. For FSPS we used a the \texttt{emcee} Markov Chain Monte Carlo package \citep{emcee} coupled with the \texttt{python-fsps} interface to \texttt{FSPS} \citep{python-fsps}. For more detail on the python wrapper software for FSPS, see Hagen et al. (2016b, in prep). 

In our use of \texttt{FSPS}, we found that the outputs could not be used for further analysis, as we hit an edge in the parameter distribution for the strength of the radiation field. The dust emission models used in \texttt{FSPS}, from \cite{draine07}, allow the strength of the radiation field go to twenty-five times the Milky Way level. The output distributions for all galaxies consistently hit the edge of this range, meaning that our results our biased as there are well-fitting models that lie outside the range of the \texttt{FSPS} software. While we do not use the physical parameter outputs, there is still a lesson to be learned here -- the radiation field intensities in these galaxies are very high compared to the Milky Way. This is consistent with their compact nature and star formation rates. We also hope that this finding provides motivation to increase the parameter range in the dust emission models in \texttt{FSPS}.

\subsection{MAGPHYS}

We use \texttt{Magphys} for SED fitting for the rest of this paper. In particular, we use the version of \texttt{Magphys} for high-z galaxies, as described by \cite{dacunha15}.  We will briefly summarize the \texttt{Magphys} approach here; for more details, see Sections 3 \& 4 of \cite{dacunha15} 
\texttt{Magphys} uses a library of 50,000 stellar models adapted for modeling high-z galaxies. The \cite{dacunha15} high-z extension to \texttt{Magphys} has added high dust opacities, higher star formation rates, and younger ages. Note that the code also includes low dust opacities, low SFRs, and old ages so it does not bias itself. 

\texttt{Magphys} uses the \cite{bruzual07} updated versions of the \cite{bruzual03} stellar population synthesis models. Dust attenuation is computed using the two component model of \cite{charlot00}; this model applies an additional ``birth-cloud" opacity for stars younger than $10^7$ years. The shape of the dust law is a power law as detailed in \cite{charlot00}. 

The star formation history is split into two parts -- a continuos SFR and stochastic bursts. The continuous SFH is a continuous delayed exponential of the form $\psi \propto \gamma^2 t \exp \left( -\gamma t \right)$ where $t$ is the time since the onset of star formation and $\gamma = \frac{1}{\tau_{SF}}$.  This form of the star formation history is quite flexible and physically motivated, as it rises in early times, flattens out, and then exponentially declines. Thus it can match everything from the increasing SFR for very young galaxies to the decreasing SFR of older galaxies. The parameter range of $\gamma$ is very broad, so that the peak of SFR can happen anywhere from 0.7-13.3 Gyr after the onset of star formation. Accounting for stochastic bursts is done by imposing random bursts on top of the continuous SFH. The bursts can last from 30-300 Myr and can vary in strength from 0.1-100 times the continuous SFH. \cite{dacunha15} states ``We set the probability of a burst of star formation occurring at any random time in the previous 2 Gyrs to 75\%." Including the stochastic bursts allows for \texttt{Magphys} to account for a much broader range of possible star formation histories than a simple continuous function with adding additional parameters.

The dust emission is modeling using four components: empirical templates for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), mid-IR continuum for hot dust, warm dust (30 - 80 K in stellar birth clouds) in thermal equilibrium, and cool dust (20 - 40 K in the diffuse ISM) in thermal equilibrium. The strengths of these four components are floating parameters in the model. The SED of the dust in thermal equilibrium follows a modified blackbody curve of the form $\nu^{\beta} B_\nu (T)$ where $\beta = 1.5$ for warm dust and $\beta = 2.0$ for cool dust. \cite{dacunha15} also notes that, while the empirical PAH templates may not match SMG PAH emission precisely, the typical PAH contribution to the total dust emission is $< 10\%$ and so uncertainties in the PAH templates won't have a large effect on the results.

The actual SED fitting in \texttt{Magphys} is done by generating model spectra at the redshift of the galaxy in question. These are convolved with filters and compared to the observed data. The log likelihood of a particular model is $-\chi^2 / 2$ (under assumptions of Gaussian uncertainties), and the likelihoods of each parameter are built up through comparison of all the generated models. We note that the Bayesian nature of this code returns the distributions, not just best-fit values, for each model parameter. This is incredibly important, as degeneracies in SED fitting, particularly with large numbers of parameters, are quite common. Being able to explore the distribution enables us to understand how constrained each particular parameter is.
